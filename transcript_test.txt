Fully defecated myself as a 24 year old man . Completely defecated myself once as a grown adult last week . I had been at a friend's house for a few days for his birthday weekend , and was finally heading home . A weekend's worth of food caught up on me as I was heading to the bus to travel from city to city , but I pushed through the pain . I was running a bit late , so I knew I wouldn't have time to use the restroom before getting on the bus - not really an issue , I thought , if worst comes to worst I can always use the facilities on the bus . Got on the bus , and saw the 'out of order' sign on their toilet (how can you even let an inter-city bus run with no functioning restroom in the year 2024 ? ) Debated getting off the bus and catching the next one in an hour and a half so I could take care of my business , but thought forget it , I'm a grown man , I'm 24 , I can hold it for a few hours . During the journey , it just gets worse and worse . A dull ache becomes a great pain , and it's at the point where I'm finding it difficult to even stay seated . Eventually , the bus pulls into the station . As I get up from my seat , I'm already defecating a little bit , a small amount escaping containment . I walk off the bus , and as I step out onto the pavement , I just sigh and let go . My body had had enough . Boxers = filled , immediately . I look around , to see if anyone's noticed my deed or my now bulging pants , and I walk to the nearest pub . Thankfully , everything stays contained , so my jeans are at least somewhat spared (minus a minor amount of staining . ) I get to the pub , sneak in , change and clean up . The boxer briefs go in the nearby bin , I pull my jeans back on , make sure the toilet cubicle is as clean as it was when I came in (I may be a pants defecator , but I'm not going to ruin some janitor's day) , and walk home . Sent a picture to a friend , laughed about it , continued my day , and life goes on . You have to laugh about it when it happens , but a lesson has definitely been learned in the philosophy of taking risks .
