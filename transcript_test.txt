Am I the Asshole for refusing to take my sister to the Renaissance Faire because of what she wants to wear? I, a twenty-five-year-old female, am the oldest of four kids. My brother, Sam, is a twenty-year-old male, and my sisters are Maddy, a seventeen-year-old female, and Kiara, a twelve-year-old female. I have been going to the Renaissance Faire since I was sixteen, usually with friends, but once Sam and Maddy were thirteen, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned twelve a few months ago and said she wanted to go to the Renaissance Faire this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom, and once she gave the okay, I actually got excited because, very sadly, Sam is in the Marines and cannot go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear. Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since the last Renaissance Faire (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks, but I made it clear that the Renaissance Faire is not the place for that, and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the materials. She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to the Renaissance Faire. I told her she absolutely could, but again, I would not be the one taking her if she chose to wear that. She got upset and said I was being unfair because I was still taking Maddy. I told her again that the Renaissance Faire is not the place for that, and who I take with me is up to me. She is now very upset with me and is trying to get our mom to make me take her wearing her furry suit. So, am I the Asshole?
