An example video produced by the script.
It took a post from r/AmITheAsshole and ran it through GPT-4 to make the text flow better (expanding acronyms like AITA, fixing grammar, etc.).
It then selected the appropriate voice (female) and translated the content to spanish,
finally exporting the video in both English and Spanish.
